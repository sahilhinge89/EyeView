# EyeView

EyeView is a real-time intelligent camera system that detects misbehavior and sends alerts to administrators. It leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection, Flask for backend services, and React for the frontend interface. This project aims to provide enhanced safety in public areas by monitoring behavior in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time video feed streaming
- Misbehavior detection using YOLO
- Alert notifications for detected misbehaviors
- User-friendly interface built with React
- Database storage for alerts using SQLite

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Socket.IO, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Flask, Flask-SocketIO, Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Machine Learning:** YOLOv4
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Video Processing:** OpenCV

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- OpenCV
- Flask and other Python dependencies

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eyeview.git
cd eyeview
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `Backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the YOLOv4 weights and configuration files and place them in the `Backend` directory:
   - [YOLOv4 weights](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/yolov4/yolov4.weights)
   - [YOLOv4 configuration](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov4.cfg)
   - [coco.names](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names)

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `Frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. Install required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the application through your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. The video feed will automatically start displaying in the app.
3. Any detected misbehavior will trigger an alert displayed on the frontend.

## Configuration

- Modify the `app.py` file in the Backend folder to adjust detection settings or change the video feed source.
- You can change the behavior detection logic in the `detect_misbehavior` function according to your requirements.
