# EyeView

EyeView is an intelligent camera system designed to detect misbehavior in real time. It leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and Flask for backend functionality.

## Features

- Real-time video streaming
- Detection of potential fights based on proximity of people
- Alerts for dangerous objects being held by individuals
- Database integration to store alerts

## Note

This application is still undergoing improvements, and some features may be added or refined in future versions.

- Flask
- Flask-SocketIO
- Flask-CORS
- Flask-Migrate
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## YOLO Setup

The YOLO model is included in this repository:

- `yolov4.weights` - YOLO model weights
- `yolov4.cfg` - YOLO model configuration
- `coco.names` - Class labels for COCO dataset

These files can be found in the repository under the `/Backend` directory.

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahilhinge89/EyeView.git
   cd EyeView
   ```

2. Ensure you have the required YOLO files in place:

   - Place `yolov4.weights`, `yolov4.cfg`, and `coco.names` in the `/Backend` directory.

3. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/video_feed` to view the application.

## Frontend Setup

To start the frontend application:

1. Open another terminal and navigate to the `EyeView` directory:

   ```bash
   cd eye-view
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the frontend interface.

## Usage

The application will start streaming video from the camera and will print alerts to the console when misbehavior is detected.
